# React-Native-Blog-App
My first project with React Native using expo.

## Install dependencies
After cloning the repository, to install the dependencies run

```
yarn install
```
----------------------------
## Add firebase config
Once the dependencied have been installed, make sure to add your own
firebaseConfig file under lib/firebase.js and also make sure to enable 
email password authentication with firebase for the app.

------------------------------------
Once that is done, start the app with

```
yarn start
```

Then The expo devTools should appear in your default browser. Open an emulator 
then press 'Run on android' or 'Run on ios' in the devTools to run the app in the emulator.
